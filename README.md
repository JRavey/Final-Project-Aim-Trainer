## Description

I made an aim trainer using Pygame. When running a starting timer of 30 seconds will count down. During this time a target will appear. Click on this target and a new one will appear in a random location. While you click on these targets 2 variables will be tracked. How many targets you have hit, and how often have you hit these targets.

Once the timer ends you will be presented with an end screen. This end screen shows how much time you played, how often you hit the targets, how many targets you hit, and your accuracy. There is also a leaderboard. This leaderboard will track the top 3 scores that have happened on the local machine. This means you can close the program and run it again, if you get a better score, it will be presented on the top 3 leaderboard.

The leaderboard will be stored in the file "score.txt" The program will not come with the file, however, a file will be created when the program is started. In this file, the top 3 scores will be stored. Once the file is created the program will use this file each time the program runs.


A future area of improvement that I could take away from this project is time management. My time management for this project is very poor and I became stressed all the time. I was not able to implement some features such as a main menu due to how much time I wasted.
